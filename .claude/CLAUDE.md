## Code Review Preferences

When reviewing PRs and the user asks to leave comments:
- **Prefer inline comments** on specific lines of code over top-level review comments
- Use the GitHub reviews API to submit comments attached to specific file paths and line numbers
- Reserve the top-level review body for a brief summary/approval only
